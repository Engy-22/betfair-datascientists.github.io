# Bet Angel: Automating simultaneous markets

## Dont miss out on a market with simultaneous automation

If you have a concern of missing markets due to delays or unforeseen circumstances, Bet Angel is able to work off multiple worksheets for different meetings, all from the same workbook. 
For example, we can have worksheet one from our spreadsheet work through the markets taking place in Flemington, while worksheet 2 will work through markets at Sandown, worksheet 3 works through markets at Bendigo etc. 

To Set this up, we need to do need to duplicate the main ‘Market’ worksheet and have enough instances of the sheet for each meeting. There are four meetings that I want to cover, so I have duplicated the worksheet four times and renamed them to help me keep track.

Once this is done, save the file and close out of it completely (Bet Angel will open it back up for us automatically when we’re ready to start our automation). 
In Bet Angel, follow the usual process of clicking the ‘Guardian’ Icon             , select your markets and the usual ‘Browse for file’ button to locate your Excel file. 

The only thing you will need to do differently for Bet Angel is to simply allocate a specific worksheet to a particular market that you are betting on.

When you’re ready for automation to take over, click the ‘Connect’ check box and then it will do its thing.

### And you're set!

Once you've set your spreadsheet set up and you're comfortable using Bet Angel Pro it should only take a number of seconds to load your markets and set your strategy running for the day. Just make sure you have all of the app settings correctly selected before you leave the bot to run, as some of them reset by default when you turn the program off.

!!! info "Note:" 
    you will need to leave your computer up and running for the duration of the chosen markets, as the program needs the computer to be 'awake' to be able to run.
