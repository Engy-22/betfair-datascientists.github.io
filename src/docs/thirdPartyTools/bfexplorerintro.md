###- Bfexplorer additional features

Bfexplorer users also have the ability to use an integrated spreadsheet functionality which can be used to record bet data from any automation that you run through the program.

For the more tech savvy automators who may not want to fully dive into the Betfair API, Bfexplorer is an open platform that allows users to create their own plugins directly. Using F# and .Net languages, you can add any additional usability to Bfexplorer by simply placing a .fsx file into the Bfexplorer directory on your computer. This is a particularly powerful ability for users to have and is something that many other third-party tools don't include.
