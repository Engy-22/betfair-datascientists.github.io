The data available includes prices, volume traded, winning status, average weighted price, BSP, and a variety of other details that are valuable for modelling and strategy development. We know that the process of downloading and extracting these data files can be a bit intimidating the first time round, so here's a walk through of one way to go about it to help make it more accessible. Data tiers There are three tiers of historic data available on this site. You can download samples of each tier of data here . The biggest differece is between the free and paid data. The free data includes a lot of information about the market, but no volume, and only last traded price per minute, not a full price ladder. The two paid tiers include the same data, just at different frequencies. If your strategy isn't particularly price sensitive and doesn't need volume as a variable then you'll probably be fine wtih the free tier, however if you need to see a more granular view of the market then you should probably consider the paid advanced or pro tiers. A full catalogue of the values included in each data tier is available here . Basic Advanced Pro 1 minute intervals last traded price no volume 1 second intervals price ladder volume API tick intervals (50ms) price ladder volume Purchasing the data \u00b6 Start by going to the Betfair Historic Data site and log in using your Betfair account. Note: if you have less than 100 Betfair points you may have problems downloading data. On the Home page select the data set you want to download. Free data You need to 'purchase' the data set you want to download, even if it's from the free tier You can only 'purchase' each time period of data once. For example, if you had previously 'purchased' all Greyhound data for January 2018, then tried to download Greyhound data for January to March 2018 you would receive an error, and would need to purchase the data for February to March instead. Once you 'purchase' your choice of data it's recommended that you go to the My Data page, and choose the subset of data to then download. Downloading the data \u00b6 On the My Data page you can filter the purchased data to the actual markets you're interested in. You can filter by Sport, Date range, EventId, Event Name, Market Type, Country & File Type (M = market, E = Event), which will cut down the size of the data you need to download. For example, if you wanted the win market for Australian and New Zealand greyhound races you'd use these filters. File type The file type filter has two options that you can choose from: E = Event - includes event level data, i.e. Geelong greyhounds on x date M = Market - includes market level data, i.e. the win market for Geelong greyhounds race 3 on x date The site can be pretty slow to download from, and you'll generally have a better experience if you download the data a bit at a time, say month by month. Alternatively if you're going to download a lot of data it might be worth having a look at the historic data API, that can automate the download process and speed it up significantly. There's a guide available here , and some sample code the help get you started. Unzipping the files \u00b6 You'll need to download a program to unzip the TAR files. Here we'll be using 7Zip , which is free, open source and generally well respected. Once you've downloaded it make sure you also instal it onto the computer you'll be using to open the data files. Locate the data.tar file in your computer's file explorer program. Right click on the file, select '7-Zip' from the menu then choose 'Extract files...'. In the model that pops up change the pathmode to 'No pathnames'. You can also change the name and/or path of the folder you want the files extracted to if you want to. You now have a collection of .bz2 files. The final step is to select all the files, right click, select '7-Zip' from the menu then choose 'Extract here'. This will then extract all the individual zipped files which you can then either open in a text editor - you can use something basic like Notepad (installed on basically all computers by default) or a more complete program like Visual Studio Code (my go to), Vim or Notepad++ - or you can parse over the using a program to do the work for you. We'll explore how to parse the data another time. If you're opening the files with a text editor you might need to right click, choose 'open with' and select your preferred program. What's it for? \u00b6 The data available on the Historic Data site is extensive, and can be a really valuable tool or input. For example, you can include some of the columns as variables in a predictive model, compare BSP odds against win rates, or determine the average length of time it takes for 2 year old horses to run 1200m at Geelong. Quality data underpins the vast majority of successful betting strategies, so becoming comfortable working with the data available to you is a really important part of both the modelling and automation processes.

This lets you choose your selections based on market sentiment close to the jump, and not worry about current market price by using BSP to place your bets. You could equally use effectively the same approach if you wanted to lay the favourite(s) instead of back them. Building on our previous articles , we're using the spreadsheet functionality available in Bet Angel Pro to implement this strategy. If you haven't already I'd recommend going back and having a read of this article , as the concepts here do build on what we covered previously. As I've said before, there are so many different ways to use this part of Bet Angel and I'm very open to any thoughts about more effective ways of implementing this sort of strategy. You're welcome to reach out to me on bdp@betfair.com.au with your feedback and opinions. The plan \u00b6 Given that we're simply choosing our selections based on the market we don't need any ratings for this strategy. The plan is to look at the market a couple of minutes before the scheduled jump and place BSP bets based on its formation. My approach here, and how I've set up the accompanying spreadsheet, backs the top two runners in the market two minutes out from the scheduled start time using the Betfair Starting Price. Resources Rules: here's the spreadsheet I set up with my macros and rules included, but you'll obviously need to tweak it to suit your strategy and approach Tool: Bet Angel Pro Set up \u00b6 Make sure you've downloaded and installed Bet Angel Pro, and signed in. Once you open the program up click on the 'G' Guardian icon and open the Guardian functionality up. Writing your rules \u00b6 As with any automated strategy, one of the most important steps is deciding what logical approach you want to take, and writing rules that suit. I'm using a customised version of the default Bet Angel template Excel sheet to implement my strategy, so it can make betting decisions based on the favourites being shown in the market. Excel is an excellent tool, but it can take an investment of time to be able to use it effectively. This is how I used Excel to implement my set of rules. Trigger to place bet \u00b6 In short, I want to back runners when: the selection's available to back price (the blue box on the Exchange) is either the lowest or second lowest in the market - the top two market favourites the scheduled event start time is less than 2 minutes away the event isn't in play This is my trigger on Excel formula: Multi line =IF( AND( (COUNT($G$9,$G$11,$G$13,$G$15,$G$17,$G$19,$G$21,$G$23,$G$25,$G$27,$G$29,$G$31,$G$33,$G$35,$G$37,$G$39,$G$41,$G$43,$G$45,$G$47,$G$49,$G$51,$G$53,$G$55,$G$57,$G$59,$G$61,$G$63,$G$65,$G$67)-RANK(G9,($G$9,$G$11,$G$13,$G$15,$G$17,$G$19,$G$21,$G$23,$G$25,$G$27,$G$29,$G$31,$G$33,$G$35,$G$37,$G$39,$G$41,$G$43,$G$45,$G$47,$G$49,$G$51,$G$53,$G$55,$G$57,$G$59,$G$61,$G$63,$G$65,$G$67))+1) < 3, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, SETTINGS!$E$4 > 60, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND((COUNT($G$9,$G$11,$G$13,$G$15,$G$17,$G$19,$G$21,$G$23,$G$25,$G$27,$G$29,$G$31,$G$33,$G$35,$G$37,$G$39,$G$41,$G$43,$G$45,$G$47,$G$49,$G$51,$G$53,$G$55,$G$57,$G$59,$G$61,$G$63,$G$65,$G$67)-RANK(G9,($G$9,$G$11,$G$13,$G$15,$G$17,$G$19,$G$21,$G$23,$G$25,$G$27,$G$29,$G$31,$G$33,$G$35,$G$37,$G$39,$G$41,$G$43,$G$45,$G$47,$G$49,$G$51,$G$53,$G$55,$G$57,$G$59,$G$61,$G$63,$G$65,$G$67))+1) < 3, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, SETTINGS!$E$4 > 60, ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Stepping through each step: Finding the top two selections in the market: check each runner to see if they're one of the two market favourites - I'm doing this by going through the best available to back (blue) price for each runner, ranking them in order (which sorts them from highest to lowest - which is the opposite of what we want) then subtracting that rank number from the total number of selections available to inverse the order. Finally I plus one to the resulting rank - if I didn't do this then you'd have a rank order that started at 0, not 1, and I thought that would just confuse matters! Once it's established what each selection's rank is, we then check if that rank is less than three, and if it is we know that the runner in question is one of the top two in the market, based on the current available to back prices. =IF( AND( (COUNT($G$9,$G$11,$G$13,$G$15,$G$17,$G$19,$G$21,$G$23,$G$25,$G$27,$G$29,$G$31,$G$33,$G$35,$G$37,$G$39,$G$41,$G$43,$G$45,$G$47,$G$49,$G$51,$G$53,$G$55,$G$57,$G$59,$G$61,$G$63,$G$65,$G$67)-RANK(G9,($G$9,$G$11,$G$13,$G$15,$G$17,$G$19,$G$21,$G$23,$G$25,$G$27,$G$29,$G$31,$G$33,$G$35,$G$37,$G$39,$G$41,$G$43,$G$45,$G$47,$G$49,$G$51,$G$53,$G$55,$G$57,$G$59,$G$61,$G$63,$G$65,$G$67))+1) < 3, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, SETTINGS!$E$4 > 60, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Time < 2 mins and > 1 min: check whether the seconds left on the countdown are smaller than 120 (2 minutes) and greater than 60 (1 minute), as we need to both place the bet and then convert it to a BSP bet before the off (more on this later).

Preparing the spreadsheet \u00b6 You need to copy/paste these three formulas into the relevant cell on each green row - I copied mine into all of the coloured cells in the sheet, just in case the fields are bigger in future events. Excel is clever enough to automatically update the relative links in the formulas, so you should be able to copy/paste the same formula into each cell as long as you've got your relative and absolute references straight .

I'm keeping it simple and using flat staking here, so will just place $10 on each runner. This goes in column N (N9 for the first runner). We've got some good resources on the Hub that look at different staking approaches - these might be useful in helping you decide which strategy you want to use. 10 Global Command: this is what triggers the open bets to convert to BSP, and only goes in one cell, L6. As soon as the countdown timer reaches less than 60 seconds this will fire. ''' =IF(SETTINGS! E E 4 < 60, \"TAKE_SP_ALL\", \"\") ''' You know the drill \u00b6 The process is effectively the same from here on as for our previously automated strategy, but I've included it here just in case you want a refresher or are new to Bet Angel Pro. Selecting markets \u00b6 I used the markets menu in the Guardian tool to navigate to the tracks I had ratings for, then multi-selected all the win markets by holding down the control key and clicking on the different markets. If you wanted to include all horse or greyhound races for a day you could use the 'quick picks' tab to do this more efficiently. Once you've chosen the races you're interested in click the 'add' button and you'll see them appear in the main body of the screen. Make sure you sort the races by start time , so Bet Angel will automatically move through them in the right order and allocate the next race to the spreadsheet once the previous one ends. You do this by clicking on the 'start time' column heading until the races are in time order (when the arrow is pointing up). Linking the spreadsheet \u00b6 Open the 'Excel' tab in Guardian, then use the browse functionality to choose the spreadsheet you've been working on. From there, click on 'open workbook', then make sure you have 'connect', 'auto-bind Bet Angel sheets and 'auto-clear Bet Angel bindings' all selected. You also need to make sure that the first race has the 'Bet Angel' tab selected in the 'Excel sheet' column - from there it will then automatically update this for each race as one finishes and the next one begins. And you're set! \u00b6 Once you've set your spreadsheet set up and you're comfortable using Bet Angel Pro it should only take a number of seconds to load your markets and set your strategy running for the day. Just make sure you have all of the app settings correctly selected before you leave the bot to run, as some of them reset by default when you turn the program off. Note: I appreciate it's obvious, but you will need to leave your computer up and running for the duration of the chosen markets, as the program needs the computer to be 'awake' to be able to run. Bet Angel features \u00b6 Here are some Bet Angel features that you'll need to consider. Multiple bets/clearing status cells \u00b6 The Bet Angel spreadsheet won't let a bet go on if there is a value in column 0 for the runner, the 'status' column, to avoid accidentally placing multiple bets unintentionally. As soon as a bet triggers, Bet Angel automatically changes this cell to 'PLACING', then to 'PLACED' when the bet is confirmed as having been received by Betfair. In this strategy I only want to place one bet per runner, but if you wanted to place multiple bets on a runner you'd need to have a play wtih the macros to clear the 'status' cells more regularly, and instead reference the number of bets placed/matched in columns T:AE. Careful here though, as the values in these columns sometimes take a little time to update, and I've had more bets go on than I intended when using these cells as my check, as bet trigger reevaluated before columns T:AE had updated. As we want to use the same sheet for multiple races, and the 'status' cells don't clear automatically, I've created a macro in the Excel sheet that auto-clears the status and global status cells whenever a new race loads. It also clears the cells if they say 'FAILED', as I found that if there were internet network issues or similar it would fail once then not try to place the bet again. This was based on some logic I found in a forum discussion on Bet Angel . If you're feeling adventurous you can have a play with the macros and edit them to suit your specific needs. Turning off bet confirmation \u00b6 Unless you want to manually confirm each individual bet you're placing (which you definitely might want to do until you feel comfortable that the program and strategy are behaving as you expect) you'll need to go into the 'Settings' tab on the main Bet Angel Pro program, click 'Edit settings', go to the 'Behaviour' tab, and remove the tick at the top next to 'Confirm Bets?' - you can then save these settings. Editing the spreadsheet \u00b6 The spreadsheet really doesn't like it when you try and edit it 'live', so make sure you untick 'connect' on the Excel tab in Guardian before you make any changes, save the sheet, then tick 'connect' again once you've finished your edits. Areas for improvement \u00b6 There are parts of this approach that I'm still trying to get to work to my liking, and I'll update this article as I find better solutions. If you have any suggestions for improvements please reach out to bdp@betfair.com.au - I'd love to hear your thoughts. For example, the spreadsheet only binds with one market at a time, so if one market gets delayed and runs overtime the program won't be able to move on to the next market - I missed some races because of this. Also, if the market changes significantly in those last few minutes and a third selection shortens in past the two we've placed bets on you could end up with bets on more than the intended two runner. This is something you could check for in your bet rule if you wanted to ensure you were only backing a set number of runners. What next? \u00b6 We're working through some of the popular automation tools and creating articles like this one to help you learn how to use them to implement different styles of strategies. If you have any thoughts or feedback on this article or other programs you'd like to see us explore please reach out to bdp@betfair.com.au - this article has already been updated with extra learnings including variable percentages and new macros.

Finally I plus one to the resulting rank - if I didn't do this then you'd have a rank order that started at 0, not 1, and I thought that would just confuse matters!

This makes them ideal for automation, where you use a program to place bets on your behalf while you get on with other things. Bet Angel Pro has a spreadsheet functionality that lets you place bets using your own variables and information from the live market, which is what I've used here to automate these ratings. There are so many different ways to use this part of Bet Angel and I'm very open to any thoughts about more effective ways of implementing this sort of strategy. You're welcome to reach out to me on bdp@betfair.com.au with your feedback and opinions. The plan \u00b6 I'm using the Greyhound Ratings Model put together by some of my Data Scientist colleagues. This model creates ratings for Victorian greyhound races daily and is freely available on the Hub. It's pretty good at predicting winners, so I'm going to place back bets on the dogs with shorter ratings where the market price is better than the model's rating. Bet Angel Pro's 'Guardian' feature has the capacity to let you create spreadsheets with pretty complicated rules that can be applied to multiple markets, which is what I've used for the automation here. Here I'll step through how I went about getting Bet Angel Pro to place bets using the ratings from Betfair's DataScientists' Greyhound Ratings Model . Once it's set up the goal is to be able to upload a new set of ratings, choose your races, set the program running and be able to walk away. Resources Tips: Betfair Data Scientists' Greyhound Ratings Model Rules: here's the spreadsheet I set up with my macros and rules included, but you'll obviously need to tweak it to suit your strategy and the format of your ratings Tool: Bet Angel Pro Set up \u00b6 Make sure you've downloaded and installed Bet Angel Pro, and signed in. Once you open the program up click on the 'G' Guardian icon and open the Guardian functionality up. Finding & formatting ratings \u00b6 Here I'm using the ratings shared by our Data Scientists on the Hub . This makes for a bit of prep work, copying the list of runners and their rating into an Excel spreadsheet. As a minimum you'll need a list of runner names (including the runner number followed by a full stop, i.e. 1. Runner Name) in one column and their rating in another in an Excel sheet. If you have a list of ratings already in a spreadsheet that's even better - you'll be able to tweak the Excel formulas to work with whatever format your data is in. Wherever your ratings come from, you'll need to include them in the spreadsheet you're using to interact wtih Bet Angel. Here I'm using a spreadsheet I edited for this strategy , and I've included a tab called RATINGS where you can copy in the runner names and ratings. Writing your rules \u00b6 As with any automated strategy, one of the most important steps is deciding what logical approach you want to take, and writing rules that suit. I'm using a customised version of the default Bet Angel template Excel sheet to implement my strategy, so it can make betting decisions based on my ratings. Excel is an excellent tool, but it can take an investment of time to be able to use it effectively. This is how I used Excel to implement my set of rules. Trigger to place bet \u00b6 In short, I want to back runners when: the available to back price is better than the rating for that runner by a variable percentage they have a rating less than 5 the scheduled event start time is less than 2 minutes away the event isn't in play This is my trigger on Excel formula: Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5,SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120,ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Stepping through each step: Price > rating * percentage offset: check whether the available to back price is better than the runner's rating multipled by a percentage - I do this by using the runner name in column B and looking up the corresponding rating for that runner from the RATINGS sheet. Percentage offset: There are lots of different approaches you can take to this. I'm using a variable percentage offset, as I appreciate that we might want a different percentage better than the rating, depending on the price - i.e. 10% better than 2 ( 2 ( 2.20) is very different than 10% better than a 20 shot ( 20 shot ( 22.20), so here I'm using a vlookup table to determine the percentage better than the rating that I want based on the current odds. Here are the 'ranges' of prices to percentage offset that I'm using - you can disregard this and just change it to be a set percentage (i.e. *1.1 hardcoded into the forumla) or just use your rating straight without an offset, or edit the ranges in the SETTINGS tab to suit your opinions. This table takes the 'min' odds for the range in the left column, and the number you want to multiply the odds by in the right column - so for 15% you'd multiply by 1.15 etc. Viewing your values: I've added columns (AF:AH) to show the rating, percentage offset and minimum acceptable odds for each runner, to add some reassurance that the spreadsheet is pulling the values we want it to. ODDS RANGE % MULTIPLIER 1 - 5 1.1 (10%) 5 - 8 1.15 (15%) 8 - 15 1.2 (20%) 15 - 20 1.3 (30%) 20 - 33 1.4 (40%) 33 + 1.5 (50%) Here are three different examples of formulas you can use here, depending on your approach: Variable percentage =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Fixed percentage =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Pure rating =IF( AND( G9 > INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Updating references to suit your ratings format If your ratings are formatted differently to my simple runner name | rating layout you can easily edit the formula to refence the relevant column directly, instead of changing your ratings to fit the formula. Let's say your ratings sheet is set out like this: race date | venue | runner name | last race time | weight | rating Here's the set up of the formula: RATINGS!B:B[your rating],MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A[runner name],0)) So your edited formula would be: RATINGS!F:F,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!C:C,0)) You need to make sure that you updated these references both in the this part of the formula, and in the next step too. Rating < 5: check whether the runner's rating is less than 5 (because I only want to bet on the favourite few runners) =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Time < 2 mins: check whether the seconds left on the countdown are smaller than 120 (2 minutes), as the majority of markets don't fully form until the last few minutes before the off. This one's a bit complicated, as the time is actually returned as a percentage of a 24 hour day, which you need to convert into positive or negative seconds. You can read about the formula here or just keep it simple by referencing the value in cell E4 of the SETTINGS sheet, where I've already done the calculations for you. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Not in play: checking whether the event has gone in play - as odds change so much in the run I only want to use this strategy pre-play. If this cell is blank it means it's not displaying the 'in-play' flag, so it's safe to place bets. I appreciate that greyhound races don't go in play, but I wanted this check in place anyway in case I (or you!) wanted to use a version of this strategy on horse racing in the future. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Result: if the statement above is true, the formula returns \"BACK\", at which point the bet will trigger, otherwise the cell will remain blank and no bet will be placed. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Excel functions IF statement: IF(if this is true, do this, else do this) AND statement: AND(this is true, and so is this, and so is this) - returns true or false VLOOKUP: looking up a value from a table based on the value you pass in Absolute references: if you're copy/pasting formulas it's important that you make links absolute when you don't want the cell being referenced to change relative to the new cell the formula is being pasted into. You do this by putting a $ in front of the parts of the reference you don't want to 'move'. Preparing the spreadsheet \u00b6 You need to copy/paste these three formulas into the relevant cell on each green row - I copied mine into all of the coloured cells in the sheet, just in case the fields are bigger in future events. Excel is clever enough to automatically update the relative links in the formulas, so you should be able to copy/paste the same formula into each cell as long as you've got your relative and absolute references straight . Trigger bet rule: this is the bet trigger Excel formula we created earlier, and it needs to go in column L (L9 for the first runner). Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5,SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120,ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Odds: initially I was using the runner's rating as the price, but I got a bet placement error for some of the selections - eventually I realised that the odds the bet's being placed at need to be valid Betfair 'ticks' . For simplicity's sake I'm now just using the currently available back odds (cell G9 for the first runner). This goes in column M (M9 for the first runner). Another option would be to create a look up table that rounded your rating to the nearest 'tick' price - if you do this, please do send me through your formula and I'll add it to this article. =G9 Stake: it's completely up to you what staking approach you want to take. I've kept it simple, and am just using a 'to win' strategy. Each bet aims to win $10 on that runner at the curret odds. The formula divides $10 by the current available best back odds (cell G9 for the first runner) minus one to get the stake required to win $10. This goes in column N (N9 for the first runner). We've got some good resources on the Hub that look at different staking approaches - these might be useful in helping you decide which strategy you want to use. =10/(G9-1) Selecting markets \u00b6 I used the markets menu in the Guardian tool to navigate to the tracks I had ratings for, then multi-selected all the win markets by holding down the control key and clicking on the different markets. If you wanted to include all horse or greyhound races for a day you could use the 'quick picks' tab to do this more efficiently. Once you've chosen the races you're interested in click the 'add' button and you'll see them appear in the main body of the screen. Make sure you sort the races by start time , so Bet Angel will automatically move through them in the right order and allocate the next race to the spreadsheet once the previous one ends. You do this by clicking on the 'start time' column heading until the races are in time order (when the arrow is pointing up). Linking the spreadsheet \u00b6 Open the 'Excel' tab in Guardian, then use the browse functionality to choose the spreadsheet you've been working on. From there, click on 'open workbook', then make sure you have 'connect', 'auto-bind Bet Angel sheets and 'auto-clear Bet Angel bindings' all selected. You also need to make sure that the first race has the 'Bet Angel' tab selected in the 'Excel sheet' column - from there it will then automatically update this for each race as one finishes and the next one begins. And you're set! \u00b6 Once you've set your spreadsheet set up and you're comfortable using Bet Angel Pro it should only take a number of seconds to load your markets and ratings up and set your strategy running for the day. Just make sure you have all of the app settings correctly selected before you leave the bot to run, as some of them reset by default when you turn the program off. Note: you will need to leave your computer up and running for the duration of the chosen markets, as the program needs the computer to be 'awake' to be able to run. Bet Angel features \u00b6 Here are some Bet Angel features that you'll need to consider. Multiple bets/clearing status cells \u00b6 The Bet Angel spreadsheet won't let a bet go on if there is a value in column 0 for the runner, the 'status' column, to avoid accidentally placing multiple bets unintentionally. As soon as a bet triggers, Bet Angel automatically changes this cell to 'PLACING', then to 'PLACED' when the bet is confirmed as having been received by Betfair. In this strategy I only want to place one bet per runner, but if you wanted to place multiple bets on a runner you'd need to have a play wtih the macros to clear the 'status' cells more regularly, and instead reference the number of bets placed/matched in columns T:AE.

This was based on some logic I found in a forum discussion on Bet Angel . If you're feeling adventurous you can have a play with the macros and edit them to suit your specific needs. Turning off bet confirmation \u00b6 Unless you want to manually confirm each individual bet you're placing (which you definitely might want to do until you feel comfortable that the program and strategy are behaving as you expect) you'll need to go into the 'Settings' tab on the main Bet Angel Pro program, click 'Edit settings', go to the 'Behaviour' tab, and remove the tick at the top next to 'Confirm Bets?' - you can then save these settings. Editing the spreadsheet \u00b6 The spreadsheet really doesn't like it when you try and edit it 'live', so make sure you untick 'connect' on the Excel tab in Guardian before you make any changes, save the sheet, then tick 'connect' again once you've finished your edits. Areas for improvement \u00b6 There are parts of this approach that I'm still trying to get to work to my liking, and I'll update this article as I find better solutions. If you have any suggestions for improvements please reach out to bdp@betfair.com.au - I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Wherever your ratings come from, you'll need to include them in the spreadsheet you're using to interact wtih Bet Angel. Here I'm using a spreadsheet I edited for this strategy , and I've included a tab called RATINGS where you can copy in the runner names and ratings.","title":"Finding &amp; formatting ratings"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#writing-your-rules","text":"As with any automated strategy, one of the most important steps is deciding what logical approach you want to take, and writing rules that suit. I'm using a customised version of the default Bet Angel template Excel sheet to implement my strategy, so it can make betting decisions based on my ratings. Excel is an excellent tool, but it can take an investment of time to be able to use it effectively. This is how I used Excel to implement my set of rules.","title":"Writing your rules"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#trigger-to-place-bet","text":"In short, I want to back runners when: the available to back price is better than the rating for that runner by a variable percentage they have a rating less than 5 the scheduled event start time is less than 2 minutes away the event isn't in play This is my trigger on Excel formula: Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5,SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120,ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Stepping through each step: Price > rating * percentage offset: check whether the available to back price is better than the runner's rating multipled by a percentage - I do this by using the runner name in column B and looking up the corresponding rating for that runner from the RATINGS sheet. Percentage offset: There are lots of different approaches you can take to this. I'm using a variable percentage offset, as I appreciate that we might want a different percentage better than the rating, depending on the price - i.e. 10% better than 2 ( 2 ( 2.20) is very different than 10% better than a 20 shot ( 20 shot ( 22.20), so here I'm using a vlookup table to determine the percentage better than the rating that I want based on the current odds. Here are the 'ranges' of prices to percentage offset that I'm using - you can disregard this and just change it to be a set percentage (i.e. *1.1 hardcoded into the forumla) or just use your rating straight without an offset, or edit the ranges in the SETTINGS tab to suit your opinions. This table takes the 'min' odds for the range in the left column, and the number you want to multiply the odds by in the right column - so for 15% you'd multiply by 1.15 etc. Viewing your values: I've added columns (AF:AH) to show the rating, percentage offset and minimum acceptable odds for each runner, to add some reassurance that the spreadsheet is pulling the values we want it to. ODDS RANGE % MULTIPLIER 1 - 5 1.1 (10%) 5 - 8 1.15 (15%) 8 - 15 1.2 (20%) 15 - 20 1.3 (30%) 20 - 33 1.4 (40%) 33 + 1.5 (50%) Here are three different examples of formulas you can use here, depending on your approach: Variable percentage =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Fixed percentage =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Pure rating =IF( AND( G9 > INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Updating references to suit your ratings format If your ratings are formatted differently to my simple runner name | rating layout you can easily edit the formula to refence the relevant column directly, instead of changing your ratings to fit the formula. Let's say your ratings sheet is set out like this: race date | venue | runner name | last race time | weight | rating Here's the set up of the formula: RATINGS!B:B[your rating],MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A[runner name],0)) So your edited formula would be: RATINGS!F:F,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!C:C,0)) You need to make sure that you updated these references both in the this part of the formula, and in the next step too. Rating < 5: check whether the runner's rating is less than 5 (because I only want to bet on the favourite few runners) =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Time < 2 mins: check whether the seconds left on the countdown are smaller than 120 (2 minutes), as the majority of markets don't fully form until the last few minutes before the off. This one's a bit complicated, as the time is actually returned as a percentage of a 24 hour day, which you need to convert into positive or negative seconds. You can read about the formula here or just keep it simple by referencing the value in cell E4 of the SETTINGS sheet, where I've already done the calculations for you. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Not in play: checking whether the event has gone in play - as odds change so much in the run I only want to use this strategy pre-play. If this cell is blank it means it's not displaying the 'in-play' flag, so it's safe to place bets. I appreciate that greyhound races don't go in play, but I wanted this check in place anyway in case I (or you!) wanted to use a version of this strategy on horse racing in the future. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Result: if the statement above is true, the formula returns \"BACK\", at which point the bet will trigger, otherwise the cell will remain blank and no bet will be placed. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*VLOOKUP(INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)),SETTINGS!$C$12:$D$17,2)), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, SETTINGS!$E$4 < 120, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Excel functions IF statement: IF(if this is true, do this, else do this) AND statement: AND(this is true, and so is this, and so is this) - returns true or false VLOOKUP: looking up a value from a table based on the value you pass in Absolute references: if you're copy/pasting formulas it's important that you make links absolute when you don't want the cell being referenced to change relative to the new cell the formula is being pasted into. You do this by putting a $ in front of the parts of the reference you don't want to 'move'.","title":"Trigger to place bet"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/betAngelRatingsAutomation/#preparing-the-spreadsheet","text":"You need to copy/paste these three formulas into the relevant cell on each green row - I copied mine into all of the coloured cells in the sheet, just in case the fields are bigger in future events.

For simplicity's sake I'm now just using the currently available back odds (cell G9 for the first runner). This goes in column M (M9 for the first runner). Another option would be to create a look up table that rounded your rating to the nearest 'tick' price - if you do this, please do send me through your formula and I'll add it to this article. =G9 Stake: it's completely up to you what staking approach you want to take. I've kept it simple, and am just using a 'to win' strategy. Each bet aims to win $10 on that runner at the curret odds. The formula divides $10 by the current available best back odds (cell G9 for the first runner) minus one to get the stake required to win $10. This goes in column N (N9 for the first runner).

In this strategy I only want to place one bet per runner, but if you wanted to place multiple bets on a runner you'd need to have a play wtih the macros to clear the 'status' cells more regularly, and instead reference the number of bets placed/matched in columns T:AE. Careful here though, as the values in these columns sometimes take a little time to update, and I've had more bets go on than I intended when using these cells as my check, as bet trigger reevaluated before columns T:AE had updated. As we want to use the same sheet for multiple races, and the 'status' cells don't clear automatically, I've created a macro in the Excel sheet that auto-clears the status cells whenever a new race loads. It also clears the cells if they say 'FAILED', as I found that if there were internet network issues or similar it would fail once then not try to place the bet again.

This makes for a bit of prep work, copying the list of runners and their rating into an Excel spreadsheet. As a minimum you'll need a list of runner names (including the runner number followed by a full stop, i.e. 1. Runner Name) in one column and their rating in another in an Excel sheet. If you have a list of ratings already in a spreadsheet that's even better - you'll be able to tweak the Excel formulas to work with whatever format your data is in. Wherever your ratings come from, you'll need to include them in the spreadsheet you're using to interact wtih Gruss. Here I'm using a spreadsheet I edited for this strategy , and I've included a tab called RATINGS where you can copy in the runner names and ratings. Writing a rule \u00b6 As with any automated strategy, one of the most important steps is deciding what logical approach you want to take, and writing rules that suit. I'm using a customised version of the default Gruss template Excel sheet to implement my strategy, so it can make betting decisions based on my ratings. Excel is an excellent tool, but it can take an investment of time to be able to use it effectively. There are lots of posts on the Gruss Forum on the topic if you want to explore it more yourself. This is how I used Excel to implement my set of rules. Trigger to place bet \u00b6 In short, I want to back runners when: the available to back price is better than the rating for that runner by at least 10% they have a rating less than 5 the scheduled event start time is less than 2 minutes away there isn't a bet already placed on the runner the event isn't in play This is my trigger on Excel formula: Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Stepping through each step: Price > rating: check whether the available to back price is better than the runner's rating multipled by 1.1 (10%) - I do this by using the runner name in column B and looking up the corresponding rating for that runner from the RATINGS sheet. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Updating references to suit your ratings format If your ratings are formatted differently to my simple runner name | rating layout you can easily edit the formula to refence the relevant column directly, instead of changing your ratings to fit the formula. Let's say your ratings sheet is set out like this: race date | venue | runner name | last race time | weight | rating Here's the set up of the formula: RATINGS!B:B[your rating],MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A[runner name],0)) So your edited formula would be: RATINGS!F:F,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!C:C,0)) You need to make sure that you updated these references both in the this part of the formula, and in the next step too. Rating < 5: check whether the runner's rating is less than 5 (because I only want to bet on the favourite few runners) =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Time < 2 mins: check whether the seconds left on the countdown are smaller than 120 (2 minutes), as the majority of markets don't fully form until the last few minutes before the off. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) No existing bet: checking whether a bet's already been placed on the runner, as I only want the bet to place once. The number of bets matched on the runner shows in column AB - obviously there are other ways you can check this, but whichever one you go with you'll need a check in place to make sure your bets don't fire again and again, unless that's part of your strategy! =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Not in play: checking whether the event has gone in play - as odds change so much in the run I only want to use this strategy pre-play. If this cell is blank it means it's not displaying the 'in-play' flag, so it's safe to place bets. I appreciate that greyhound races don't go in play, but I wanted this check in place anyway in case I (or you!) wanted to use a version of this strategy on horse racing in the future. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Result: if the statement above is true, the formula returns \"BACK\", at which point the bet will trigger, otherwise the cell will remain blank and no bet will be placed. =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Excel functions IF statement: IF(if this is true, do this, else do this) AND statement: AND(this is true, and so is this, and so is this) - returns true or false Absolute references: if you're copy/pasting formulas it's important that you make links absolute when you don't want the cell being referenced to change relative to the new cell the formula is being pasted into. You do this by putting a $ in front of the parts of the reference you don't want to 'move'. Preparing the spreadsheet \u00b6 You need to copy/paste these three formulas into the relevant cell on each green row - I did a few extra rows than the number of runners in the markets I was looking at, just in case the fields are bigger in future events. Excel is clever enough to automatically update the relative links in the formulas, so you should be able to copy/paste the same formula into each cell as long as you've got your relative and absolute references straight . Trigger bet rule: this is the bet trigger Excel formula we created earlier, and it needs to go in column AE (AE5 for the first runner). Multi line =IF( AND( G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1), INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)), \"BACK\", \"\" ) Single line =IF(AND(G9 > (INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0))*1.1),INDEX(RATINGS!B:B,MATCH(B9,RATINGS!A:A,0)) < 5, Sheet2!$E$4 < 120, AB10 < 1, ISBLANK($G$1)),\"BACK\",\"\") Odds: initially I was using the runner's rating as the price, but I got a bet placement error for some of the selections - eventually I realised that the odds the bet's being placed at need to be valid Betfair 'ticks' . For simplicity's sake I'm now just using the currently available back odds (cell G5 for the first runner). This goes in column R (R5 for the first runner). Another option would be to create a look up table that rounded your rating to the nearest 'tick' price - if you do this, please do send me through your formula and I'll add it to this article. =R5 Stake: it's completely up to you what staking approach you want to take. I've kept it simple, and am just using a 'to win' strategy. Each bet aims to win $10 on that runner at the curret odds. The formula divides $10 by the current available best back odds (cell R5 for the first runner) minus one to get the stake required to win $10. This goes in column AC (AC5 for the first runner). We've got some good resources on the Hub that look at different staking approaches - these might be useful in helping you decide which strategy you want to use. =10/(R5-1) Selecting markets \u00b6 TO DO Linking the spreadsheet \u00b6 TO DO And you're set! \u00b6 Once you've set your spreadsheet set up and you're comfortable using Gruss Betting Assistant it should only take a number of seconds to load your markets and ratings up and set your strategy running for the day. Just make sure you have all of the app settings correctly selected before you leave the bot to run, as some of them reset by default when you turn the program off. Note: you will need to leave your computer up and running for the duration of the chosen markets, as the program needs the computer to be 'awake' to be able to run. Gruss features \u00b6 Here are some Bet Angel features that you'll need to consider: Clearing status cells: if there is a value in the status cell then no bets will place for that runner, to avoid placing duplicate bets accidentally. As we want to use the same sheet for multiple races, and our bet trigger rule includes a check to see whether we already have a bet on the runner, I created a macro in the Excel sheet that auto-clears the status cells every 5 seconds. This was based on some logic I found in a forum discussion on Bet Angel . Turning off bet confirmation: unless you want to manually confirm each individual bet you're placing (which you definitely might want to do until you feel comfortable that the program and strategy are behaving as you expect) you'll need to go into the 'Settings' tab on the main Bet Angel Pro program, click 'Edit settings', go to the 'Behaviour' tab, and remove the tick at the top next to 'Confirm Bets?'. You can then save these settings, but you'll need to go into the settings tab and choose the saved file each time you open the program to change the default confirmation behaviour. Editing the spreadsheet: the spreadsheet really doesn't like it when you try and edit it 'live', so make sure you untick 'connect' on the Excel tab in Guardian before you make any changes, save the sheet, then tick 'connect' again once you've finished your edits. Areas for improvement \u00b6 There are parts of this approach that I'm still trying to get to work to my liking, and I'll update this article as I find better solutions. If you have any suggestions for improvements please reach out to bdp@betfair.com.au - I'd love to hear your thoughts. For example, the spreadsheet only binds with one market at a time, so if one market gets delayed and runs overtime the program won't be able to move on to the next market - I missed some races because of this. What next? \u00b6 We're working through some of the popular automation tools and creating articles like this one to help you learn how to use them to implement different styles of strategies. If you have any thoughts or feedback on this article or other programs you'd like to see us explore please reach out to bdp@betfair.com.au Disclaimer \u00b6 Note that whilst automated strategies are fun and rewarding to create, we can't promise that your betting strategy will be profitable. If you're implementing your own strategies please gamble responsibly and note that you are responsible for any winnings/losses incurred.","title":"Gruss Betting Assistant - ratings automation"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/grussRatingsAutomation/#gruss-betting-assistant-ratings-automation","text":"","title":"Gruss Betting Assistant - ratings automation"},{"location":"thirdPartyTools/grussRatingsAutomation/#automating-a-ratings-based-strategy-using-gruss-betting-assistant","text":"Ratings are the basis for a lot of betting strategies, but they can be paricularly painful and time-consuming to implement manually. This makes them ideal for automation, where you use a program to place bets on your behalf while you get on with other things. Bet Angel Pro has a spreadsheet functionality that lets you place bets using your own variables and information from the live market, which is what I've used here to automate these ratings. There are so many different ways to use this part of Bet Angel and I'm very open to any thoughts about more effecitve ways of implementing this sort of strategy.

This model creates ratings for Victorian greyhound races daily and is freely available on the Hub. It's pretty good at predicting winners, so I'm going to place back bets on the dogs with shorter ratings where the market price is better than the model's rating. Gruss Betting Assistant's Excel triggered betting feature has the capacity to let you create spreadsheets with pretty complicated rules that can be applied to multiple markets, which is what I've used for the automation here. Here I'll step through how I went about getting Bet Angel Pro to place bets using the ratings from Betfair's DataScientists' Greyhound Ratings Model . Once it's set up the goal is to be able to upload a new set of ratings, choose your races, set the program running and be able to walk away.
